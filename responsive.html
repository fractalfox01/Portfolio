    <p class="aboutmain">I'm a freelance website developer/designer and, owner of CodeRealms LLC. As-well-as website

        <p class="lineUp">I've taken a slower route then others in jumping into the programming world, not learning
            until after my K-12 years. Now I'm about 8 years into this passion, and loving it!</p>
        <p class="lineUp">While I have attended a few years of tech courses at CCC (Coconino Community College), A large
            portion of my education is self-taught and, admittedly contains gaps. I'm very eager to fill those gaps and
            spend most of my time working with things I haven't used before, in an attempt of weeding out those missing
            gaps.</p>
        <p class="lineUp">The majority of my time is spent on advancing my knowledge in Math, Physics, InfoSec,
            Programming Structure and Techniques, etc..</p>
        <p class="lineUp">My passion for computer work, I think, is somewhat different than others. I don't fatigue
            easily from screen time. I can easily spend 12+ hours at a screen. That's not to say I don't stay active.
            I'm an avid hiker and try to take a portion of each day to get out and explore. But, I'm intrigued by the
            challenges that programming can introduce, and the power of good that can come from solving them. It seems
            to keep me energized while Im working.</p>

<div id="pythonInfo">
    <div id="pyImg"></div>
    <p class="infoText">Python</p>
    <p class="info">I have around three years experience in Python. I first started learning Python while in preparation
        for a Python course at CCC (Coconino Community College).</p>
    <p class="info">During the course I became involve in coding challenges through sites like Codefights, Codewars,
        etc.. I found the language has a simple syntax, You have the opportunity to write a lot less code when compared
        to other languages. For
        that reason, I think python is an ideal language for scripting automation of processes.</p>
    <p class="info">The most useful thing I've created using the language is a GUI application (covered in the '<a
            id="hrefProjects" class="link" href="#projLink">Projects</a>' area).</p>
    <p class="info">I also have misc. Python scripts I've written since; Being stored at my Github account (Found in the
        ''<a id="hrefLinks" class="link" href="">Links</a>' area).</p>
</div>
<div id="wordpressInfo">
    <div id="wordImg"></div>
    <p class="infoText">Wordpress</p>
    <p class="info">Before focusing on Python I put some of my previous knowledge of HTML and CSS to use. I started by
        setting-up and hosting a private site on my home network. For a site theme/idea I chose a structured, page
        separated index on my current studies at the time.From there a private site hosted on a local LAN eveolved to
        several public facing websites!</p>
    <p class="info">While the main focus was towards gaining knowledge working on and maintaining sites hosted to the
        public, I didn't want to spend to much time in having to configure a back-end.</p>
    <p class="info">Thus, Wordpress came into play. With the choice of Wordpress and Wordpress themes, I was able to get
        a relatively well structured site up and running in a small amount of time.</p>
    <p class="info">While Wordpress made it relatively simple to create something without needing to think much about
        design, it has some faults. for one, it's someone else's code i.e. not maintained by you. second - if you want
        to keep a secure server, then it's going to add some regular updates to your schedule.</p>
</div>
<div id="linuxInfo">
    <div id="linuxImg"></div>
    <p class="infoText">Linux</p>
    <p class="info">I first got into Linux around 8 years ago, my first encounter? <a target="_new" id="hrefUbuntu"
                                                                                      class="link"
                                                                                      href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>!
        what else would it be, right!</p>
    <p class="info">At first I was just interested in a computer that could do more, for 'free'. I had next to no
        practical tech know-how. I just knew I was sick of what I had. It was limited, and I had no access to anything.
        Not really a good environment if you're curious about how things work.</p>
    <p class="info">So I started out like any normal person does. Looking around, poking things here and there, diving
        into online tutorials and How-To's. Broke thing's, severely. And learned a lot throughout the process.</p>
    <p class="info">Once I started collage I was drawn towards the Linux courses. I was extremely fortunate in joining
        the course when I did and lucked out on an incredible instructor.</p>
    <p class="info">The college offers two courses. I've learned an incredible amount of helpful things in each. This is
        where I finally got a chance to dive into TCP/IP and communication protocols.</p>
    <p class="info">Through out the course's we touched on many topics. Both courses were truly challenging and brought
        me to a new level, particularly the second. Topics covered a width ranged, from basic scripting to designing,
        building, and securing a mock enterprise level network.</p>
</div>
<div id="hTmlInfo">
    <div id="htmlImg"></div>
    <div id="cssImg"></div>
    <p class="infoText">Html/CSS</p>
    <p class="info">HTML & CSS are pretty straight forward. Easy syntax, great documentation. In the last few years
        these two languages have come a long, long way. Close to anything you can think of that you want to do, has
        either already been done or there's something close enough to modify that you can make work.</p>
    <p class="info">Everything I can think about these two leads back to documentation and the fact that they've already
        been widely used and written about.</p>
    <p class="info">I started learning both through book's and a quick web server a friend had written up with Visual
        Basic .NET</p>
    <p class="info">These were the early day's in my programming journey and I still had no oriented goal for using any
        of it, I just knew it was valuable and it didn't drive me to boredom.</p>
    <p class="info">Later on, I eventually found uses for everything I had been learning. when I started building my
        personal home study site, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do, What I was able to do and, how to go
        about doing it thanks to the earlier time I had invested.</p>
</div>
<div id="bootstrapInfo">
    <div id="bootstrapImg"></div>
    <p class="infoText">Bootstrap</p>
    <p class="info">So far, in my limited experience, I've found some uses in bootstrap. Some of it's benefits
        are that it handles automatic device scaling, which is nice. It has good documentation that's easy to
        read. It's pretty simple to work with and makes creating basic, clean, web-pages in hardly any time,
        easy and with ease.</p>
    <p class="info">With all of that said, I'd rather create my own work. Not to say I don't keep it in my
        toolbox, because I do. It's all of the above and more, but It's limited.</p>
    <p class="info">My experience with Bootstrap is sort, I've only used it on a few (single page) projects. And
        even then it was basic. The experience was nice though and I can see it's power. Which is why I continue
        to play with it and why I include it as one of my skills.</p>
</div>
<div id="javascriptInfo">
    <div id="javascriptImg"></div>
    <p class="infoText">Javascript</p>
    <p class="info">Javascript is amazing! My time with javascript has been short so-far, but I've been working
        with it in a large capacity for the last few months and couldn't be enjoying it more.</p>
    <p class="info">The power of javascript is pretty impressive on it's own, it's extensive. It's incredibly
        easy to work with. Incredible documentation everywhere. I really can't say enough good things. Then
        there's the extensive selection of frameworks and libraries for open use. jQuery, Three.js, Bootstrap,
        QUnit, etc.. etc.. Anything you need, somebodies probably already done it.</p>
    <p class="info">The fact that it took this long to start working with it is amazing, I'm not sure how that
        happened.</p>
    <p class="info">The project that I'm most happy with is the Simon game I created as the last assignment in
        the Freecodecamp.org's Front-End Developer certification. The project is covered in the 'Projects'
        section below.</p>
    <p class="info">While working on the Simon game, I completely wrote and re-wrote my js code 5 or 6 times.
        This project had me stumped a few times. I'd be making great progress and smack, no way to proceed to
        the next step. The frustration grew intense at points, but was so worth it when I finally found my way.
        The whole thing really did challenge me to learn some new concepts I hadn't understood before. The final
        method that worked for completing the game was physically drawing out (on a dry-erase board) every
        single step of the game and reverse engineering my functions from there.</p>
</div>
<div id="bashInfo">
    <div id="bashImg"></div>
    <p class="infoText">Bash</p>
    <p class="info">My time with bash goes back a ways (for me). Not long after first booting up Ubuntu, I
        started becoming familiar with the cli. I didn't really get into my own scripting until much later on.
        these first few years were spent mostly in confusion of the whole structure of things.</p>
    <p class="info">As green as could be, Linux intimidated me. Those first few years were fun, my main goals
        were just to be able to perform normal 'everyday' function. I rifled through tutorials, punching in
        whatever they said to do (and more). Not understanding much, but laying a good foundation.</p>
    <p class="info">The Linux Administration courses I took are where I really started getting deep into the
        power of Bash. Up until this point I had (for the most part) just been editing other peoples scripts.
        Now I finally got to learn what they were all about!!
        I finally got a chance to go over the basics in a structured order.</p>
    <p class="info">The Linux Administration II course tasked the class to build an enterprise level network as
        a group, assigning each individual work and rotating
        roles with-in the team. This was my first major collaboration with a team on a tech project. The network
        had many requirements needed for a passing grade. We
        needed a disaster recovery plan, an auth server, vm's acting as employee nodes, internal DNS, etc..</p>
    <p class="info">The script I'm most proud of, a Bash program that would install and setup 'enterprise wide',
        full configuration for a server/client LDAP authentication service. View script <a href="">Here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="javaInfo">
    <div id="javaImg"></div>
    <p class="infoText">Java</p>
    <p class="info">My experience with Java has been short so far. The language shares many, many similarities
        with C# which made it fairly easy to pick up. Up till now my experience with Java has primarily been
        working on an Udemy course and random tutorials around the web.</p>
    <p class="info">I immediately liked working with Java as it's a powerful language. The documentation is
        extensive, Java even has a built-in JavaDocs for creating a structured documentation of your own
        programs! That's pretty cool. Another big positive for java is, it's a cross-platform language. Meaning,
        that unlike C# (which is proprietary to Microsoft), Java works on Mac and Linux too.</p>
    <p class="info">As my history with Java is limited to course work, I don't have much to show on it. The most
        interesting of which can be viewed in the Projects section.</p>
